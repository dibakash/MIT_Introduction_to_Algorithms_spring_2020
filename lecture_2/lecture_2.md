## Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays

- Interface (API/ADT) Vs Data Structure
  - Interface is specification, Data structure is representation
  - Interface tells us what data can store, Data structure tell us how to store data
  - interface specify what operations are supported and what they mean, Data structure gives us algorithms to how to support those operations
  - Interface can be thought of problem statements and DSA are solutions

### 2 Main Interfaces

- set
- sequence
  - [5,2,9,7]

### 2 Data Structure Approaches

- arrays
- pointer based
